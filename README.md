JavaScript was used to implement features such as opening and closing modal windows, button scrolling, smooth scrolling, page navigation using event delegation, tabbed content, menu fade animation, sticky navigation menu, slow section reveal, lazy loading images and slider animations using arrow buttons and dots.

This site was created by Jonas Schmedtmann for the Udemy course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert! I made several changes to the appearance and used more modern JavaScript functions and techniques. 

Note: Smooth scrolling must be enabled on the browser in order for it to work. Turning off Windows animations will prevent this from working unless explicitly enabling it in the browser.
